# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview
    In this project, an interactive geographical map of earthquakes from all over the world was created for Disaster Reporting Network, a non profit company that provides data driven story on disasters around the world. To achieve this, GeoJSON data from US geographical survey website were retrieved using JavaScript, D3 and Leaflet libraries. The data was then plotted using the Mapbox map through an API request. 

## Results
      On the map, the magnitude and the location of each earthquake was shown using a pop-up marker. In addition, the diameter of each earthquake represents the magnitude which corresponds to their size and color. Specifically, the higher the magnitude of an earthquake, the bigger the diameter and the darker the color of the marker. Legends were also added to show the corresponding color with respect to the intensity of each earthquake. Lastly, fault lines were also added to illustrate the relationship between the frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates. Refer to the images below to see the earthquake map in different map styles: street, satellite and dark.
